# Chakravala Sampler for Pell's Equation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Chakravala method** for finding minimal solutions \((x,y)\) to Pell's equations of the form:

\[
x^2 - N y^2 = 1, \quad N \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2},\ N \text{ not a perfect square}.
\]

It was developed as part of a research project exploring the distribution of “super-large” minimal solutions.

## What this script does
- Randomly **samples non-square values of N** over a chosen range.
- Uses the **Chakravala algorithm** to compute the minimal solution for each.
- Exports results (N, x, y) to an **Excel spreadsheet**.
- Provides reproducibility with a random seed.

---

## Requirements
The script needs a few Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `tqdm`
- `xlsxwriter` (optional; fallback to default Excel writer if missing)

You can install them with:
```bash
pip install pandas tqdm xlsxwriter
